I plan on adding a whole bunch of scripts here seperate from my other repository intended for scripters!
these will include: my own and new reanimte script, a stand-alone and good hat moving script, cool tips & tricks and a whole lot of general resources.

the unmade/unfinished scripts idea wall (updating):

mobile compatibility assisting scripts (movement and other stuff),
finalize my own reanimation scripts
